## Yet Another Website

This is the only virtual space where I will share some opinions about software engineering, cybersecurity (and philosophy maybe)!


### Creations

- [mkCTF](https://github.com/koromodako/mkctf) is a framework to enable efficient team work when preparing challenges for a CTF

- [aionyphe](https://github.com/koromodako/aionyphe) is a useful library and command line tool to automate [Onyphe](https://www.onyphe.io/) queries 

- [hbsrecover](https://github.com/koromodako/hbsrecover) is a commmand line tool to recover encrypted files backed up using _QNAP Hybrid Backup Sync_

- Now retired [Picsou](https://github.com/koromodako/picsou), a Qt-based program that helps me keep track of expenses. It's not beautiful and but it's useful


### Contributions

- Volatility Framework code migration (Python 2 to Python 3) available [here](https://github.com/koromodako/volatility)

- Migrated [Google/Timesketch](https://github.com/google/timesketch/releases/tag/20230628) to docker compose V2
 
- Contributing to INS'hAck Capture The Flag by making challenges for people around the world is a great hobby. Here are the repositories for past editions ([2019](https://github.com/InsecurityAsso/inshack-2019), [2018](https://github.com/InsecurityAsso/inshack-2018), [2017](https://github.com/InsecurityAsso/inshack-2017), [2016](https://github.com/InsecurityAsso/inshack-2016))

- Now retired [MapIF](https://github.com/LoicTouzard/mapif) was a funny website created to keep track of engineering school friends after we graduated. Precision was voluntarily limited to the city scale to preserve privacy


### Engineering school projects

Some of INSA projects:

- [INSA-4IF-Raspberry-OS](https://github.com/koromodako/INSA-4IF-Raspberry-OS) is an implementation of a basic OS for RaspberryPi
- [INSA-4IF-Prolog-Abalone](https://github.com/koromodako/INSA-4IF-Prolog-Abalone) is an implementation of Abalone game in Prolog with an AI
- [INSA-4IF-Lutin-Interpreter](https://github.com/koromodako/INSA-4IF-Lutin-Interpreter) is an implementation of a basic language interpreter

Some of UCD projects:

- [UCD-5IF-AI-Yavalath](https://github.com/koromodako/UCD-5IF-AI-Yavalath) is an implementation of Yavalath game with an IA
- [UCD-5IF-PACC-MatrixMultOpenMPI](https://github.com/koromodako/UCD-5IF-PACC-MatrixMultOpenMPI) is an implementation of matrix multiplication using OpenMPI


### Must-see Projects

Here, you will find a non-exhaustive list of projects/organisations that I really appreciate:

- Sharing knowledge is vital for the computer ecosystem, many thanks to [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and [The Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/)
 
- High-level is extremely powerful, cross platform and far less time consuming, kudos to [Python](https://www.python.org/)

- Low-level is faster than anything else, thanks to [C](https://devdocs.io/c/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
 
- Hacking requires creativity and determination, open your chakras looking at [Root-Me](https://root-me.org), [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) and [Hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz)
 
- Documenting is not an option, many thanks to projects making this task a little bit easier, [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), [devdocs](https://devdocs.io/), [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/) and [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/)

- Ads have a considerable impact on the life on Earth, if your product is really good people talk about it, you don't need ads, take a look at [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) and [NoScript](https://noscript.net/)
 
- Privacy is a core foundation of freedom, protect it using [The Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/), [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), [RocketChat](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat), [Signal](https://github.com/signalapp) and [Matrix](https://github.com/matrix-org)
 
- Boring administrative tasks are meant to be automated, many thanks to [OpenAPIv3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification), [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Packer](https://packer.io/)
   
- Accessible and painless monitoring with [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack), [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) and [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)

- Protect your secrets with [KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) and [FIDO](https://fidoalliance.org/)
 
- Want to know if something bad happens, have a look at [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

- Best bootable USB project ever [Ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy)

And [many others](https://github.com/koromodako?tab=stars).
