## Yet Another Website

This is the only virtual space where I will share some opinions about software engineering, cybersecurity (and philosophy maybe)!

---
### Creations

* [Datashark](https://koromodako.github.io/datashark/): a framework enabling efficient forensic analysis accross operating systems. It gives the ability to forensic team members to work from the system of their choice (Linux, MacOS or Windows) and still be able use tools running exclusively on some systems without having to switch from a VM or a computer to another.

* [mkCTF](https://github.com/koromodako/mkctf): a framework to enable efficient team work when preparing challenges for a CTF.

* [hbsrecover](https://github.com/koromodako/hbsrecover): a tool to recover encrypted files backed up using _QNAP Hybrid Backup Sync_.

* [Picsou](https://github.com/koromodako/picsou): a Qt-based program that helps me keep track of expenses. It's not beautiful and but it's useful.

### Contributions

* Volatility Framework code migration (Python 2 to Python 3) available [here](https://github.com/koromodako/volatility).

* Contributing to INS'hAck Capture The Flag by making challenges for people around the world is a great hobby. Here are the repositories for past editions ([2019](https://github.com/InsecurityAsso/inshack-2019), [2018](https://github.com/InsecurityAsso/inshack-2018), [2017](https://github.com/InsecurityAsso/inshack-2017), [2016](https://github.com/InsecurityAsso/inshack-2016))

* Now retired [MapIF](https://github.com/LoicTouzard/mapif) was a funny website created to keep track of engineering school friends after we graduated. Precision was voluntarily limited to the city scale to preserve privacy.

### Engineering school projects

Some of INSA projects:

 * [INSA-4IF-Raspberry-OS](https://github.com/koromodako/INSA-4IF-Raspberry-OS) is an implementation of a basic OS for RaspberryPi.
 * [INSA-4IF-Prolog-Abalone](https://github.com/koromodako/INSA-4IF-Prolog-Abalone) is an implementation of Abalone game in Prolog with an AI.
 * [INSA-4IF-Lutin-Interpreter](https://github.com/koromodako/INSA-4IF-Lutin-Interpreter) is an implementation of a basic language interpreter.

Some of UCD projects:

 * [UCD-5IF-AI-Yavalath](https://github.com/koromodako/UCD-5IF-AI-Yavalath) is an implementation of Yavalath game with an IA.
 * [UCD-5IF-PACC-MatrixMultOpenMPI](https://github.com/koromodako/UCD-5IF-PACC-MatrixMultOpenMPI) is an implementation of matrix multiplication using OpenMPI.

### Must-see Projects

Here, you will find a non-exhaustive list of projects/organisations that I really appreciate:

 * [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and [The Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) because **sharing knowledge is vital**!
 
 * [SignalSpam](https://www.signal-spam.fr/) because **everyone can fight spam**.
 
 * [Python](https://www.python.org/) because **high-level** is less time consuming.
 
 * [C](https://devdocs.io/c/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) because **low-level** can be useful.
 
 * [Root-Me](https://root-me.org) and [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) because **hacking requires creativity and determination**.
 
 * [devdocs](https://devdocs.io/), [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/) and [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) because **documenting is not an option** (even if it can be tough sometimes).
 
 * [The Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/), [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) and [Qwant](https://lite.qwant.com/) because **privacy should not be neglected**.
 
 * [uBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) and [NoScript](https://noscript.net/) because **ads are plaguing the Internet** _and certainly not the only way to make money in this world_.
 
 * [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) because **I just want to know if something bad happens**.
 
 * [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/) because this is **the best place to chat at the time of writing**.
 
 * [OpenAPIv3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification), [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Packer](https://packer.io/) because **boring tasks are meant to be automated**.
   
 * [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana), [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus), and [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack) for **accessible and painless monitoring**.

And [many others](https://github.com/koromodako?tab=stars).
