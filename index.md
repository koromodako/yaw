## Yet Another Website

This is the only virtual space where I will share some opinions about software engineering, cybersecurity (and philosophy maybe)!

### Contributions

* Volatility Framework code migration (Python 2 to Python 3) available [here](https://github.com/koromodako/volatility).

* Contributing to INS'hAck Capture The Flag by making challenges for people around the world is a great hobby. 
  Here are the repositories for past editions (
    [2019](https://github.com/InsecurityAsso/inshack-2019), 
    [2018](https://github.com/InsecurityAsso/inshack-2018), 
    [2017](https://github.com/InsecurityAsso/inshack-2017), 
    [2016](https://github.com/InsecurityAsso/inshack-2016)
  )

* Now retired [MapIF](https://github.com/LoicTouzard/mapif) was a funny website created to keep track of engineering school 
  friends after we graduated. Precision was voluntarily limited to the city scale to preserve privacy.

### Creations

* [mkCTF](https://github.com/koromodako/mkctf) is framework to enable efficient team work when preparing challenges for a CTF.

* [Datashark](https://github.com/koromodako/datashark) is an evolution of the [PoC](https://github.com/koromodako/datashark-poc).
  It was designed to automatise the extraction of valuable information from any file whose type is known or has already been reversed. 
  Work is in progress and I do not have a lot of free time to spend on this at the moment.

* A Qt-based program called [Picsou](https://github.com/koromodako/picsou) that helps me keep track of expenses.
  It's not beautiful and but it's useful.

### Engineering school projects

Some of INSA projects:

 * [INSA-4IF-Raspberry-OS](https://github.com/koromodako/INSA-4IF-Raspberry-OS) is an implementation of a basic OS for RaspberryPi.
 * [INSA-4IF-Prolog-Abalone](https://github.com/koromodako/INSA-4IF-Prolog-Abalone) is an implementation of Abalone game in Prolog with an AI.
 * [INSA-4IF-Lutin-Interpreter](https://github.com/koromodako/INSA-4IF-Lutin-Interpreter) is an implementation of a basic language interpreter.

Some of UCD projects:

 * [UCD-5IF-AI-Yavalath](https://github.com/koromodako/UCD-5IF-AI-Yavalath) is an implementation of Yavalath game with an IA.
 * [UCD-5IF-PACC-MatrixMultOpenMPI](https://github.com/koromodako/UCD-5IF-PACC-MatrixMultOpenMPI) is an implementation of matrix multiplication using OpenMPI.


### Must-see Projects

Here, you will find a non-exhaustive list of projects/organisations that I really appreciate:

 * [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and [The Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/)
   because **sharing knowledge is vital**!
 
 * [SignalSpam](https://www.signal-spam.fr/) because **everyone can fight spam**.
 
 * [Python](https://www.python.org/) because **high-level** is less time consuming.
 
 * [C](https://devdocs.io/c/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) because **low-level** can be useful.
 
 * [Root-Me](https://root-me.org) and [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) because **hacking requires creativity
   and determination**.
 
 * [devdocs](https://devdocs.io/), 
   [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/)
   and [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) because **documenting is not an option** (even if it can be tough sometimes).
 
 * [The Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/), [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) and [Qwant](https://lite.qwant.com/) 
   because **privacy should not be neglected**.
 
 * [uBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) and [NoScript](https://noscript.net/) because 
   **ads are plaguing the Internet** _and certainly not the only way to make money in this world_.
 
 * [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) because **I just want to know if something bad happens**.
 
 * [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/) because this is **the best place to chat at the time of writing**.
 
 * [OpenAPIv3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification), 
   [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/),
   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
   and [Packer](https://packer.io/) because **boring tasks are meant to be automated**.
   
 * [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana), 
   [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus),
   and [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack) for **accessible and painless monitoring**.

And [many others](https://github.com/koromodako?tab=stars).
